    <h1>STOCK MARKET TODAY</h1>
    <P>The Dow fell Thursday, as sentiment on stocks was soured by disappointing quarterly results and expectations for the Federal Reserve to remain hawkish for longer as the tight labor market shows little sign of abating. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.76%, or 252 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.96%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.76%.
Treasury yields continued their advance as fewer than expected initial jobless claims for the third-straight week pointed to a tight labor market that threatens to underpin wage growth and inflation.</P>
     <h1>RECESSION FEARS</h1>
     <P>Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Thursday insisted the Fed was “determined to stay the course" on monetary policy tightening, and would keep rates “sufficiently restrictive for some time" to ensure inflation returns to the central bank’s 2% target.
        </p> 
            <p> The remarks from the Fed vice chair on keeping rates higher for longer have added to concerns that the Fed could overtighten policy, tipping the economy into recession.</P>

    <h1>NETFLIX EARNINGS</h1>
    <P>In Tech, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as the streaming giant reported quarterly results after the closing bell. Netflix reported Q4 results that fell short of estimates on the bottom line, but subscriber additions topped expectations.  

        <br> <br>    Netflix added 7.66 million subscribers, well above the 4.6M expected, and said it was "very optimistic” about its new advertising tier streaming model, though cautioned that it will gradually boost subscription growth.  </P>
